# LLMs Basics

What is LLMs?

<v-clicks depth="2">

- LLMs are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data, designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text.
    - *"Large"* refers to both the model's size in terms of parameters and the dataset on which it's trained. 
    - LLMs are capable of *generating text*, LLMs are also often referred to as a form of generative AI.
    - LLMs utilize an architecture called the *Transformer*

# LLMs Basics

Language Models(LMs)

- LMs estimate the probability of any sequence of word
    - **Setup**: Assume a vocabulary of words  
  $$
  V = \{W_1, W_2, W_3, \ldots, W_n\}
  $$

    - **Data**: Given a training set of example sentences

    - **Goal**: Estimate a probability distribution  
  $$
  \sum_{x \in V^{*}} p(x) = 1
  $$

# LMs before the Transformer

N-gram Language Model

**🚨 Basic Idea**: The probability of a word in a sequence depends on the previous words.  
$$
P(\text{bags}) = \frac{\text{count(students opened their bags)}}{\text{count(students opened their)}}
$$

**⚠️ Problem**: Computing probabilities of entire sequences is practically infeasible.

- Computational complexity  
- Data sparsity  
- Low generalization

# LMs before the Transformer

N-gram Language Model

- **🔁 Markov assumption**: The probability of a word depends only on the previous \( N-1 \) words.  
  $$
  P(w_n \mid w_{1:n-1}) = P(w_n \mid w_{n-N+1:n-1})
  $$

- For a sentence *students opened their __[blank]__*  
  $$
  P(w) = \frac{\text{count(opened their } w)}{\text{count(opened their)}}
  $$

# LMs before the Transformer

Problems with N-gram Language Models

**⚠️ Storage Problem**: Increasing $n$ or increasing corpus increases model size.

**⚠️ Sparsity Problem**: Not much granularity in the probability distribution.

# Language Model with RNNs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Advantages of RNN LMs
    - Contextual Understanding: RNNs can capture longer dependencies in the text when making predictions.
    - Dynamic Computation: RNNs can handle input sequences of varying lengths without needing to predefine a fixed size.
- Disadvantages of RNN LMs: In a encoder-decoder model with RNNs LMs, the hidden state of the last time step represents absolutely everything about the meaning of the source text.
    - Sequential nature of RNNs means recurrent computation is slow.
    - Information at the beginning of the sentence, especially for long sentences, may not be equally well represented in the context vector.

Self-Attention

- **Positional Encoding**: Injects some information about the order of the sequence into the model.

- **Add & Norm Layer**: Encourages training deeper models by ensuring that backpropagation through many layers does not result in vanishing or exploding gradients.

- The decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time. For each token, it uses the encoded input representations and the previously generated tokens to produce a new token.

- This process is autoregressive, meaning each token is generated based on the tokens that have been generated so far.
